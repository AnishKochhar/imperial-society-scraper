Look out for Maa month in February where we dedicate a month’s worth of events to raising money for the Maternal Aid Association. This money will help mothers in rural and developing areas of Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Our fan favourite wing crawl is sure to get your attention and it gets better and better each year. This year we will also be implementing Bangla language lessons. This could be a fun way to reconnect with your mother tongue, or a chance to learn a new language entirely. Come give it a shot to see if you could be the next big Bangla poet. And there’s so much more!

Each Ceilidh is led by a Caller, who guides you through the dances, ensuring everyone is up to speed and no one’s feet are squashed in the process. No previous experience is required- all dances will be taught on the night (just bring your enthusiasm and possible enjoyment of getting dizzy)! Even if you're not sure about dancing, you can still come for the live music and see how you feel as the night goes on! Ceilidhs are also a great way to meet new people and make new friends, so even more reason to bring your friends along and get mingling! If any of this sounds up your street, then sign up to our mailing list below and we’ll let you know when the next event will be. Everyone is welcome, so get your dancing shoes on (or just regular ones if you don’t have any) and see you soon! CALLING ALL IMPERIAL MUSICIANS: We are always looking for more eager musicians to join our Ceilidh Band! If you have experience playing folk music or would like to try it out for the first time, don’t hesitate to add your name, instrument and email to the form below, and we’ll get in touch!

Get on your dancing shoes! While our primary objectives are to provide our members and the wider college community with a taste of the North, we also aim to promote awareness of the persistent inequality between the North and South of England.

But that's not all. Our calendar is brimming with socials that'll keep the energy and excitement alive. However, the crown jewel of our events is undoubtedly 'SHAAM’, our flagship charity dinner. It's an evening you won't want to miss, where we combine delicious food, cultural performances, and a strong sense of community to make a meaningful impact. After a sold-out dinner last year and stellar performances, we're working hard to make this year's SHAAM even more spectacular, so stay tuned! If you’re a fan of chilled get-togethers, competitive bowling missions and huge laughs, PakSoc is the society for you! Whether you're a homegrown talent or an international student, we're here to welcome you with open arms and a warm cup of chai.
