No matter if you are a first-year fresher, a final-year student or a post-grad, we host a variety of events and programmes to help you develop an interest in the area of markets and trading! We run events every week during term time, whether that may be our annual London inter-uni hackathon \"Algothon\", here on campus or a speaker from one of our sponsor firms! If you don't know the first thing about markets, you're in the right place! We run an 8-week AlgoCourse to train you on all the basics you need for a career in markets, done by fellow Imperial markets interns. To apply your understanding and get real-life experience, join us at our student-managed fund, Queen's Tower Capital, where you can give it your best shot at creating trading strategies! We have a new society this year: Imperial College Women in Trading society, introducing STEM-focused women to the fast-moving world of markets by bridging the gap between hard-science classrooms and live trading floors. Find more on our website and follow us on social media: We look forward to meeting you on-campus! Feel free to contact us: algo.trade@imperial.ac.uk CSP Chair / President",

This society is a group for music lovers, those who want to discover interesting and new music, and meet other people who are also fanatically obsessed with discovering new bands. Our members possess a huge wealth of knowledge about the London music scene, the latest upcoming bands and the venues to see them, and the side street record stores nobody knows about. Along with our weekly meets in the union, the society also hosts subsidised events for members throughout the year. In the past few years, some of the bands we’ve seen include: Tame Impala, Bon Iver, Alvvays, Michael Kiwanuka, Franz Ferdinand, Four Tet, James Blake, Wild Beasts, Mac DeMarco, Bloc Party, The Vaccines, SOPHIE, Animal Collective, Foals, Flume, Fat White Family, and many many more. We meet weekly to share new music, run record store pub crawls, host a radio show on ICRadio, and regularly produce content for the Felix Music section.

After 16 years of growth, we’ve learned Dodgeball is simple, addictive, competitive, and most importantly, fun. We hold weekly training sessions in Ethos on Tuesday and Friday, and have been recognised for our work on inclusion, especially with newcomers and women. Here you can prepare for British Dodgeball matches, or just blow off some steam and chuck balls at people for a few hours. We have 3 Men’s Teams and 2 Women’s Teams in BUCS leagues, where last season both our Men’s and Women’s 1st Teams reached the National Championship Final's Day and our Women's 1s became National Champions. When not Dodging, Ducking, Dipping, Diving, or Dodging, we’re enjoying our socials. You can find us at the Union or tearing up the city with pub crawls, trampolining, and film nights (including a certain Underdog Story). And if that’s not enough, join us on our annual European Tour, with past locations like Copenhagen, Naples, and Porto. For more information, find us at the Welcome Fair or on Instagram @imperialdodgeball – come drop in on a session, we’re looking forward to meeting you!

Throughout history, women have always been excluded from medical trials and long-term studies due to factors such as menstruation and pregnancy. This has led to a huge gender health gap, which still persists today, whereby women are often misdiagnosed and mistreated due to the lack of understanding of the difference in symptoms between men and women. However, this is all changing. The industry has grown immensely in the past few years – more money, effort, and attention are dedicated to tackling unmet needs in female healthcare, from collecting new health data, conducting research studies, developing new forms of treatment and assistive technology, and more. As a society, we hope to: - ⁠Shine light on inspiring individuals and organisations who are changing the course of female healthcare research; - Supply a platform for learning and networking opportunities within this field - Expand this awareness and vision to a wider and more diverse community. Throughout the year, we host frequent events ranging from educational lecture series, panel talks from professional speakers, networking opportunities, startup fairs, social events, as well as our annual collaboration with the FemTechnology Summit and our most-anticipated FemTech Conference.

We also run a programme in the summer to connect students with internships at local startups and research positions at leading STEM universities. We are a non-religious cultural society and strive to be apolitical with our events and affiliations.

During third term, we produce our 24-hour Opera - a musical planned in secret and revealed to the cast the day before the performance, so the whole show is prepped in 24 hours! Recent productions include 'Mamma Mia', ‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show’, and ‘Kinky Boots’, with all proceeds going to charity. Light Opera is one of the most active societies within ICSM, organising at least two socials per week in first term. These nights out, along with the annual Opera Tour, will make your first term the best few months of your life! And with events like our annual Opera Dinner during second term, our ‘Big Chills’ (open-mic nights at Reynolds Bar), and ‘UH Revue’ (a sketch show competition with other London medical schools), the rest of your year will be filled with activities! The Light Opera family ranges from complete novices to those who were doing jazz hands in utero, with members spanning all years of ICSM, as well as many non-medic members!

Whether it’s the food, or the dance, or anything in between, we are proud of our heritage and want to share it with you. The events held range from Gupshup, a welcome dinner during freshers to give you a taste of our home, to Movie Nights to give you that true Punjabi feel (there are subtitles, don’t worry), to Bhangra classes, where you can learn to dance to the epic beat of a dhol drum. We also organise, present, and compete in the largest student show in the country: The Bhangra Showdown, where dancers from university teams all over the UK compete against one another to be crowned champions on stage in front of thousands of fans. Above all, we want to build a community, not of Punjabi people, but of people who appreciate everything Punjab has to give; and if you feel you don’t belong because you’re not Punjabi enough, take it from us, you are!

Our musical director is Chris Braime, who helped found the society back in 2004 from talented string players who wanted the more intimate experience of a string ensemble. As Imperial College's only ensemble just for string players, we offer a very different experience to the symphony orchestras. Rehearsals are relaxed with light refreshments, but the music is always fun and challenging and every member has the chance to make a difference. We perform at the end of each term in the local area, as well as organising social days for the players to get to know each other. Rehearsals are held on Friday evenings, with the group going for dinner afterwards. Our rehearsals start from 6pm (baton down at 6.15) on every Friday, usually in the Great Hall, but venues may change week to week. If you're interested in making yourself heard as a string player, why don't you join us? Drop us an email at icse@ic.ac.uk if you have any queries!

Regardless of what level you're at, we promise to provide you with the following: improved self-discipline, greater self-confidence, enhanced boxing skills and an unparalleled level of fitness. Throughout the year, IC Boxing enters boxers in shows and competitions and also runs events like barnights and trips to boxing events. Come along and see for yourself why boxing really is the sweet science! Sessions are priced at £4 (bookable below on the union shop) and each member will need to buy a £10 annual training pass for gym access.

Club runs every Monday at 18:30 in Blackett 539. Events (generally, all members can join a team because we make more if one fills up): Central London Chess Congress – FIDE-rated tournaments that we host twice a year (usually during November and April) with around 100 participants (discounted entry fee for all club members). London Chess League (LCL) – ECF-rated weekly matches, on weekday evenings against other teams from London. We have a team in Division 2, the highest of any university, and a team in the women's league. 2020Chess – Online blitz games against teams from around the world.

When the smog and bustle of the city gets too much, join us to see Britain's wilder side, with plenty of weird and wonderful conversations along the way. We make a trip every week, mixing fast day hikes to nearby scenic spots such as the Chiltern Hills, Seven Sisters, and even the Peak District, with a few weekend trips to Dartmoor and Snowdonia.We also have end-of-term tours farther afield to the rugged heights of the Lake District or the Isle of Skye. We subsidise all train tickets and accommodation, so prices are always low. Between the hikes, we put our feet up with socials every now and again, including weekly afternoon tea and the occasional bar night. Whether you're a beginner or advanced hiker, whatever your experience or interest, you have a place in our society.

We run regular white-water weekend trips around the most picturesque parts of England and Wales, including Snowdonia, the Lake District, and Devon. These trips are a great way to get out of London and have loads of fun. We also head further afield a few times a year to the likes of Scotland, the Alps, and Norway catering to differing skill levels so everyone has a chance to experience foreign white-water (Summer Tour is an ICCC classic). Some of our more skilled members have ventured on expeditions as far as Georgia, India, and Vietnam with their kayaks! The best way to see what ICCC has to offer is at our weekly pool sessions on Tuesday evenings at Ethos. You can get to grips with the basics or improve your freestyle tricks, then finish off with a few games of canoe polo. We then head to the Union for a pint or two after. We also hold regular socials/sports nights to get to know the other paddlers off the river! Whether drinking or non-drinking socials are your thing there's something for everyone. We look forward to seeing you on the water soon! CSP Chair / President CSP Vice Chair / President",

We’ve got an exciting year ahead packed with events, for example we're hoping for: a trip to the Jain Derasar (temples), a V&A museum tour to see ancient Jain murtis, a buzzing Diwali event with food stands, garba classes, escape rooms, treasure hunts and board game + debate nights.

Importantly, expect plenty of Indian snacks, sweets, and mithai at our events to keep things exciting. You don’t need to be Jain to join. We’re here to share the beautiful principles of Jainism—including seva (selfless service), ahimsa (non-violence), and living a mindful, peaceful life. It’s a perfect way to unwind after a hectic Imperial week and connect with like-minded friends in a positive space. So come along, bring your friends, and be part of something exciting.

From curry nights to themed pub crawls, our lively social events foster a friendly and inclusive atmosphere. This year, you can expect to find us in every Sports night at Reynolds, so come say hi! While we are proud to be a medics’ squash club, we warmly welcome non-medics as well. Our members come from all standards and across the entire university. To make squash accessible to everyone, we provide the appropriate shoes and rackets for our members. You are also welcomed to bring your own equipment! Join us not just for the game, but for the camaraderie and support. At ICSM Squash, you’ll find a family that helps you excel both on the court and in your studies.",

There are opportunities to work with government departments, attend international conferences and attend the World Health Assembly. Working closely with allied organisations, we work to raise awareness and create change in the topics we are passionate about. This can include anything from petitions to fundraisers to direct actions in front of Parliament! We run educational events to teach people what global health is and more about current affairs within the field. We also work to transform the medical curriculum to include global health to a greater extent. It is all well and good wanting to change the world but you need to know how! Here at Students for Global Health Imperial we want to build your capacity in key skills you will need to make true change. Through local and national courses, we provide you with the practical skills to do just that. There are plenty of opportunities to meet academics or other like-minded students and carry out research that interests you. Some projects in the past have included a global health university league table and a national student survey on exposure to pharmaceutical marketing.

    "description": "In TeddyBear Hospital we aim to teach children about what it means to be a healthcare professional and what happens in hospitals, in hopes of helping them overcome White Coat Anxiety and inspire them to learn more about Medicine. Every Wednesday we visit a different primary school and teach children about simple topics in Medicine. For example, how to call 999; what exactly a ‘surgery’ is; why washing your hands is important or what is the purpose of a skeleton! At the same time, we provide our volunteers with an opportunity to help the community, practice skills in paediatrics by interacting with children and even improve their teaching skills. We are a very low-commitment group – so you can join us as often or as rarely as you want! So, if you are passionate about teaching children about medicine, looking to do some low-commitment volunteering or simply curious about what we do, join us! If you have any questions, or want to find out more, please drop us a message on social media or by email.
