The annual International Tour is the highlight of CivSoc's calendar and gives students the chance to explore contemporary and traditional engineering practice outside the UK as well as sampling the social and cultural delights of some of Europe's best loved cities. Destinations in recent years have included Madrid, Seville, Belgrade, Lisbon, Naples and Bucharest. Throughout the year, regular social events, pub-crawls and bar nights are complemented by the CivSoc Careers Fair, site visits and industry talks; the latter aided by our strong links with the civil engineering industry.

Recent destinations include Norfolk, South Wales and North Yorkshire. A day in the field is followed a lovingly cooked dinner by the committee, a fancy dress dinner, and a chance get to know your fellow rock-enthusiasts. We organise evening/lunchtime talks throughout the year. Lecturers, PhD students and field experts from outside and within the department give fascinating lectures about up-and-coming topics in geology or about their own current research. Drinks, nibbles and mingling follows. A long-standing tradition where six top geologists from across the country are invited to take part in a full day of presentations on a chosen topic. This event is very popular, not just because of the quality our speakers, but because we provide free lunch and an evening drinks reception, all topped off with a celebratory dinner at a local restaurant. Symposium 2024 was called “Geology on Other Planets” – a series of short lectures by geologists leading the way in planetary research - but the event tends to alternate between both planetary and sustainable themes so make sure you come to both over your time at Imperial so you don't miss out!

Training caters to people at all levels of experience and newcomers are welcome throughout the year.

Beginner sessions are run throughout the Autumn term, where complete beginners can come to up to four sessions to try the sport out before having to decide to sign up! As a beginner, you start by learning how to fall safely before moving on to basic throwing and techniques on the ground, and within a few months you can start going to novice competitions and work your way through the grades all the way to Black belt! We offer plenty of opportunities to fight around the UK, including the National Championships in Sheffield and university team and individual competitions throughout the year.

The Krishna Consciousness Society is for open minded, deep thinkers who take an interest in spirituality and viewing things from \"outside the box\". We present eastern philosophy and allow others to share their opinions on them. The Krishna Consciousness Society is about introducing spirituality to students. We aim to reach beyond the boundaries of caste, creed and colour, by establishing the science of the soul, and to help students find spiritual solutions to material problems such as alcoholism, drug abuse, social and academic pressures by promoting simple living and high thinking. We place a greater emphasis on spirituality rather than any particular religion. The society also aims to put students in touch with Eastern spiritual techniques, such as yoga and meditation, so they can apply ancient wisdom to modern life as a student, something that we feel is becoming more popular here in the UK. It also aims to create an non- judgemental, open and safe environment in which students can discuss and ask questions about faith and philosophy without having to belong to any religion or culture.

You can undoubtedly find us having as much a great time off-court as we do on-court. We have sports night every week, team socials, curries, bowling, Christmas dinner and End of Season dinner just to name a few of our amazing events! We also go on two tours a year - International tour and Fetball tour, where we team up with the lovely ICSM Football boys for one of the most entertaining weekends of the year! I know what you’re thinking - how do you keep on top of uni work with all of this going on? Luckily our educational support is second to none, with plenty of tutorials for all year groups covering the topics you want, mock exams, and fantastic tutoring schemes for clinical exams like OSCE and PACES.

Built in 2013, it is one of the nicest ranges in London and caters to 25 yd smallbore target rifle, gallery rifle, and 10 m air pistol. The range has a clubroom with wi-fi, making it a great place to socialise after shooting, and is also fully accessible. Trips to the National Shooting Centre, Bisley, occur 2-3 times a term, giving members the opportunity to shoot fullbore at distances from 100 to 1000 yards. We also regularly run clays trips to nearby grounds where members can enjoy English Sporting Clays. We have now run two successful tours to Jersey as guests of the Jersey Pistol Club and aim to continue this. Every year, we enter several teams and individuals into BUCS Clays, Fullbore, and Smallbore, where we have always excelled and even won in the past. The club can train you to a high standard and has all the equipment for you to use! We welcome beginners to experienced shooters, so come and give it a go!

Medical - We provide a platform to discuss relevant ethical issues that we will face as well as educational support. Fellowship - We love to spend time together at regular prayer meets across various sites and socials, which provide amazing home-cooked meals and time to build lasting friendships. We are very excited to welcome freshers to our growing family with events such as a 'families' scheme, which will pair up freshers with older years who will offer support and guidance in issues of faith and in our studies.

    "description": "If you’re a new Imperial student (undergraduate or postgraduate), get in touch via email or Instagram and we’ll let you know all the information you need to get started. We have training sessions, run by our two coaches, on Monday nights at Old Deer Park in Richmond, home of ex-Premiership London Welsh RFC. We play matches on Wednesday afternoons, with our home ground being Imperial’s Harlington Sports Ground. Forwards are also invited to attend dedicated lineout sessions on Tuesday mornings before lectures near campus. Our three teams cater for all abilities and availabilities; our 1XV compete in the BUCS South Eastern 2nd Tier, with the 2XV and 3XV playing in the 3rd and 5th Tier respectively. Both our 1XV and 2XV were battling for promotion but missed out by a single result, however both teams had an unbeaten cup run, with the 1XV winning the South Eastern Conference Cup. Teams aren’t ringfenced, so every week there’s opportunity to move between teams. Every Wednesday evening, our two social secs cook up a variety of fun and interesting socials, with promised crossovers with a range of Netball clubs. Expect silly games, drinks and lots of laughs, without the culture that gives university rugby teams their usual reputation. The club has two major annual varsity matches: one against Imperial Medics and the other against LSE in The City Varsity. These exciting showcase events are the highlight of the season, both for spectators and players, and are a fantastic opportunity to be part of something special. The City Varsity, organized by our club, has become a highly anticipated event in recent years, and last year raised over £2200 for the Matt Hampson Foundation, while drawing in hundreds of spectators.

Matches are played on Wednesday afternoons, with training on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. And in 2022/23 we were Imperial's Team of the Year!! We excel both on and off the pitch as a famously sociable and friendly bunch. Our weekly socials include pubs, games, dinners and amazing fancy dress. We also love to tour and usually put on 2 very affordable tours every year (some as cheap as £20 for the whole weekend!). Past tours include Paris, Southampton, Cardiff, Seville and Vienna. We're a friendly, diverse crowd so whether you're looking to try a new, engaging sport with a great group of people or if you're a more experienced player, ICUWRFC is the place for you!

Built in 1902, this James & Browne was purchased by Guilds students in 1933 and has remained with the college ever since. Derrick, the 1926 Ner-A-Car is the second motorised mascot of the CGCU. They are some of the most exercised veteran vehicles still on the road, maintained by the dedicated students of Imperial. We take part in the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run each November, and we are keen to take out these vehicles for a drive as often as possible throughout the year. Thanks to the early 20th century engineering, we also have plenty of opportunities to get our hands dirty performing maintenance and servicing. Our regular Wednesday afternoon garage sessions are often followed by a well-earned visit to the pub. Don’t worry, these pieces of early British automotive engineering are very simple, you can easily understand how they work, even without previous mechanical experience. If you are keen on cars or motorcycles, looking for a practical, hands-on pastime, or the romance of the early 1900s makes your heart beat faster, we offer beautiful historic vehicles, good company, and fun events throughout the year – get in touch via email or social media.

    "description": "Imperial College Obstetrics and Gynaecology society was originally founded in 2013 and acts as a bridging body to help you through everything O&G related during your time here at Imperial. At the heart of what we do is a strong sense of community that we aim to foster via frequent events throughout the year, ranging from academic to more social. We organise tutorials for Years 1, 2 and 5 as well as mock PACES for our fifth-year students. Reproductive & Developmental Sciences BSc students are offered tutorials, as well as mentors, to help guide them through their coursework and research projects. Innovative talks and seminars are also held each term to raise awareness of important topics in the field such as FGM, postnatal depression and miscarriage. We also provide opportunities for our members to network with O&G professionals in order to support students interested in pursuing specialty training in these niche areas. This year, we held our very first Journal Club which has seen an impressive numbers of students in attendance. Every month, a scientific article proposed by two members of our society is brought forth and discussed, helping to nurture an interest in research for those with a passion in this field. In 2018, we held our first independent undergraduate conference, which continues to be well-attended, drawing in students from universities all over the country. We hope to further expand our reach by making our conference bigger and more impactful every year. Additionally, we host a range of events such as our Welcome Social and collaborative fundraising events with London uni O&G societies to help bring together a community of students with an interest in this specialty. Join our mailing list and follow us on social media (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) for updated information on all our events and external opportunities! Please get in touch with us by DMing us on social media or via email at obscar@ic.ac.uk! Don't miss out and get your membership NOW!

We aim to provide you with the best preparation possible for exams. •Whether you are set on finding a cure for cancer through research, keen on pursuing a career in pharmaceuticals, or simply want to learn about the side effects of aspirin for your exams - we are the society for you! •Importantly, we emphasise that students from ANY Imperial College faculty are welcome to join as members - all that is required is a curiosity and interest in pharmacology! •Our 3 key aims are as follows: 1. Revision series and tutorials for junior medical students, led by older years, to help develop a solid understanding of the syllabus and integrate this into their future clinical careers. 2. Cutting-edge talks by renowned speakers from medical, pharmaceutical and research backgrounds, aimed at cultivating interest in pharm careers or research among medical, science and business students! 3.
