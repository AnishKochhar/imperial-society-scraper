Last year, some of our guests were from Lockheed Martin, Aston Martin, Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Alpine Formula 1, British Airways, and Cathay Pacific... So don't forget to become a member and receive our weekly newsletter to stay up to date! Every year, we make sure that newcomers feel as welcomed as possible; thus, when you start the academic year, you'll be assigned aero parents who will follow you throughout the year as a part of the 'Mums & Dads program', providing you with guidance and support. This year, we'll be bringing the Alumni Mentors program so that our students can stay in contact with the graduating class, receive their recommendations, and benefit from their experience. Apart from our brilliant academically helpful plans, we’ll also have amazing socials to connect with each other closely like end-of-year boat party, Christmas dinner, and more...
