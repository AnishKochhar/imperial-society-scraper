We run events every week during term time, whether that may be our annual London inter-uni hackathon \"Algothon\", here on campus or a speaker from one of our sponsor firms! If you don't know the first thing about markets, you're in the right place! We run an 8-week AlgoCourse to train you on all the basics you need for a career in markets, done by fellow Imperial markets interns. To apply your understanding and get real-life experience, join us at our student-managed fund, Queen's Tower Capital, where you can give it your best shot at creating trading strategies! We have a new society this year: Imperial College Women in Trading society, introducing STEM-focused women to the fast-moving world of markets by bridging the gap between hard-science classrooms and live trading floors.

This society is a group for music lovers, those who want to discover interesting and new music, and meet other people who are also fanatically obsessed with discovering new bands. Our members possess a huge wealth of knowledge about the London music scene, the latest upcoming bands and the venues to see them, and the side street record stores nobody knows about. Along with our weekly meets in the union, the society also hosts subsidised events for members throughout the year. In the past few years, some of the bands we’ve seen include: Tame Impala, Bon Iver, Alvvays, Michael Kiwanuka, Franz Ferdinand, Four Tet, James Blake, Wild Beasts, Mac DeMarco, Bloc Party, The Vaccines, SOPHIE, Animal Collective, Foals, Flume, Fat White Family, and many many more. We meet weekly to share new music, run record store pub crawls, host a radio show on ICRadio, and regularly produce content for the Felix Music section.

We’re here to alleviate that pressure by helping you connect with new people and get involved with some great events and initiatives. We’ve got tonnes of events lined up, including lighthearted games nights and cultural events to get in touch with Bangladeshi heritage. Look out for Maa month in February where we dedicate a month’s worth of events to raising money for the Maternal Aid Association. This money will help mothers in rural and developing areas of Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Our fan favourite wing crawl is sure to get your attention and it gets better and better each year. This year we will also be implementing Bangla language lessons. This could be a fun way to reconnect with your mother tongue, or a chance to learn a new language entirely. Come give it a shot to see if you could be the next big Bangla poet. And there’s so much more! We are a cultural society focused on helping our members throughout uni, and making their experience unforgettable. We look forward to seeing you at our events!

The first-call band for events both in and out of the College, IC Big Band has garnered an exceptional reputation over the years, including national recognition on winning the platinum award at the National Concert Band Festival in 2017. We are a fully auditioned big band, with openings for saxophones, trumpets, trombones, rhythm, and vocalists. With an ever-expanding library with hundreds of charts, the band regularly perform sets ranging from the swing hits of Basie to the funk and fusion of Pat Metheny, and of course the classics of Miller-Ellington! We are directed by Chris Dean (leader of Syd Lawrence Orchestra), a giant in the UK big band scene, and have enjoyed plentiful gig opportunities under his direction, such as our sold-out annual gig at PizzaExpress Jazz Club (Soho) and our collaboration concert with the Syd Lawrence Orchestra in Spring 2022! As well as our outings at well-known venues in and around the capital, we also form an integral part of the Union entertainment calendar, with hugely popular termly gigs at Metric, appearances at Arts’ Nights, and our annual performances at the Summer Ball!

Last year, we launched the Biochem/BioSoc Boat Party, and we’re excited to bring it back—bigger and better. Other beloved events like Winter Wonderland, Kew Gardens, pub crawls, and ice skating will continue, along with many new ones. This year, we're also expanding our network, with exciting collaborations in the works with Biochemistry/Biotechnology societies at Oxford, UCL, and Kings. If large events aren't your thing —we’ve got plenty of smaller gatherings like bake-offs, art events, and more. As a departmental society, we’re not just here to ensure you have a fun time; we’re also committed to working with the department to enhance your academic experience. Our academic talks connect you with leading researchers, and because we know there’s more to life than science, career support services are here to help  explore different paths and navigate application processes. BiochemSoc is run by students, for students. We welcome suggestions for new events and improvements to the course. 2.\tEnhanced career support 3.\tStrengthening our student community 4.\tMore collaborations with other societies The 2024-25 committee is excited to make this another amazing year!

As a student-led initiative, we provide a platform for students of all stages and backgrounds to freely explore the most emergent themes of the life sciences. Our articles and magazine issues are also free to access – an aspect that we hope diminishes the barrier to science. Established in August 2020, we have since grown our base to over 120 yearly writers and published over 500 articles. If you join our enthusiastic group of writers, you will benefit from editorial feedback, improving your writing and research skills.

We run regular white-water weekend trips around the most picturesque parts of England and Wales, including Snowdonia, the Lake District, and Devon. These trips are a great way to get out of London and have loads of fun. We also head further afield a few times a year to the likes of Scotland, the Alps, and Norway catering to differing skill levels so everyone has a chance to experience foreign white-water (Summer Tour is an ICCC classic). Some of our more skilled members have ventured on expeditions as far as Georgia, India, and Vietnam with their kayaks! The best way to see what ICCC has to offer is at our weekly pool sessions on Tuesday evenings at Ethos. You can get to grips with the basics or improve your freestyle tricks, then finish off with a few games of canoe polo. We then head to the Union for a pint or two after. We also hold regular socials/sports nights to get to know the other paddlers off the river! Whether drinking or non-drinking socials are your thing there's something for everyone.

For those who want to play some judgment-free blitz, we have clocks. If you think chess needs an update, we love variants and are open to suggestions; our current fancy is “ring-exchange”: four boards in a circle, when a piece is taken, it gets passed to the next board, it must be seen to be believed. Club runs every Monday at 18:30 in Blackett 539. Events (generally, all members can join a team because we make more if one fills up): Central London Chess Congress – FIDE-rated tournaments that we host twice a year (usually during November and April) with around 100 participants (discounted entry fee for all club members). London Chess League (LCL) – ECF-rated weekly matches, on weekday evenings against other teams from London. We have a team in Division 2, the highest of any university, and a team in the women's league. 2020Chess – Online blitz games against teams from around the world. Club Blitz Tournaments – A few times a year, we turn our club night into a tournament for members with snacks and prizes.

The annual International Tour is the highlight of CivSoc's calendar and gives students the chance to explore contemporary and traditional engineering practice outside the UK as well as sampling the social and cultural delights of some of Europe's best loved cities. Destinations in recent years have included Madrid, Seville, Belgrade, Lisbon, Naples and Bucharest. Throughout the year, regular social events, pub-crawls and bar nights are complemented by the CivSoc Careers Fair, site visits and industry talks; the latter aided by our strong links with the civil engineering industry.

We subsidise all train tickets and accommodation, so prices are always low. Between the hikes, we put our feet up with socials every now and again, including weekly afternoon tea and the occasional bar night.

Throughout history, women have always been excluded from medical trials and long-term studies due to factors such as menstruation and pregnancy. This has led to a huge gender health gap, which still persists today, whereby women are often misdiagnosed and mistreated due to the lack of understanding of the difference in symptoms between men and women. However, this is all changing. The industry has grown immensely in the past few years – more money, effort, and attention are dedicated to tackling unmet needs in female healthcare, from collecting new health data, conducting research studies, developing new forms of treatment and assistive technology, and more. As a society, we hope to: - ⁠Shine light on inspiring individuals and organisations who are changing the course of female healthcare research; - Supply a platform for learning and networking opportunities within this field - Expand this awareness and vision to a wider and more diverse community. Throughout the year, we host frequent events ranging from educational lecture series, panel talks from professional speakers, networking opportunities, startup fairs, social events, as well as our annual collaboration with the FemTechnology Summit and our most-anticipated FemTech Conference.

      "description": "The best and most hotly anticipated events organised by the society – we head off to places of great natural beauty all over the UK to sample the best geology our country has to offer. Recent destinations include Norfolk, South Wales and North Yorkshire. A day in the field is followed a lovingly cooked dinner by the committee, a fancy dress dinner, and a chance get to know your fellow rock-enthusiasts. We organise evening/lunchtime talks throughout the year. Lecturers, PhD students and field experts from outside and within the department give fascinating lectures about up-and-coming topics in geology or about their own current research. Drinks, nibbles and mingling follows. A long-standing tradition where six top geologists from across the country are invited to take part in a full day of presentations on a chosen topic. This event is very popular, not just because of the quality our speakers, but because we provide free lunch and an evening drinks reception, all topped off with a celebratory dinner at a local restaurant. Symposium 2024 was called “Geology on Other Planets” – a series of short lectures by geologists leading the way in planetary research - but the event tends to alternate between both planetary and sustainable themes so make sure you come to both over your time at Imperial so you don't miss out!

ICGC is not only about flying - we organise several social events throughout the year, such as bar nights and dinners. We also take part in events organised by other Junior pilots, which is a great way to get to know glider pilots all over the UK. We always have a lot of fun together! If this sounds like something you'd be interested in - come for a flight and try it out for yourself! ICGC runs trips every Saturday and Sunday. These trips are open to all members regardless of experience and are the best way to get started with gliding. Sign-up forms are sent out every Monday for the following weekend.

      "description": "A Ceilidh (pronounced kay-lee) is a social gathering with traditional Scottish and Irish folk music and social dancing. Each Ceilidh is led by a Caller, who guides you through the dances, ensuring everyone is up to speed and no one’s feet are squashed in the process. No previous experience is required- all dances will be taught on the night (just bring your enthusiasm and possible enjoyment of getting dizzy)! Even if you're not sure about dancing, you can still come for the live music and see how you feel as the night goes on! Ceilidhs are also a great way to meet new people and make new friends, so even more reason to bring your friends along and get mingling! If any of this sounds up your street, then sign up to our mailing list below and we’ll let you know when the next event will be. Everyone is welcome, so get your dancing shoes on (or just regular ones if you don’t have any) and see you soon! CALLING ALL IMPERIAL MUSICIANS: We are always looking for more eager musicians to join our Ceilidh Band! If you have experience playing folk music or would like to try it out for the first time, don’t hesitate to add your name, instrument and email to the form below, and we’ll get in touch!

We’re all about creating a vibrant and welcoming community, and we'd love you to be a part of the Imperial Jain Society. Whether you’re Jain or simply curious about the faith, we’re opening our doors wide for everyone to learn something new, relax and make new friends. We’ve got an exciting year ahead packed with events, for example we're hoping for: a trip to the Jain Derasar (temples), a V&A museum tour to see ancient Jain murtis, a buzzing Diwali event with food stands, garba classes, escape rooms, treasure hunts and board game + debate nights. Plus, we’ll have inspiring talks from incredible speakers, including Jain nuns and hopefully a spoken word artist! Importantly, expect plenty of Indian snacks, sweets, and mithai at our events to keep things exciting. You don’t need to be Jain to join. We’re here to share the beautiful principles of Jainism—including seva (selfless service), ahimsa (non-violence), and living a mindful, peaceful life. It’s a perfect way to unwind after a hectic Imperial week and connect with like-minded friends in a positive space. So come along, bring your friends, and be part of something exciting. We can’t wait to meet you and make this year truly unforgettable. Here's a wonderful Jain principle: Parasparopagraho Jīvānām - \"Live and Let Live\"! See you soon at one of our events!

Training caters to people at all levels of experience and newcomers are welcome throughout the year.

Beginner sessions are run throughout the Autumn term, where complete beginners can come to up to four sessions to try the sport out before having to decide to sign up! As a beginner, you start by learning how to fall safely before moving on to basic throwing and techniques on the ground, and within a few months you can start going to novice competitions and work your way through the grades all the way to Black belt! We offer plenty of opportunities to fight around the UK, including the National Championships in Sheffield and university team and individual competitions throughout the year.

The Krishna Consciousness Society is for open minded, deep thinkers who take an interest in spirituality and viewing things from \"outside the box\". We present eastern philosophy and allow others to share their opinions on them. The Krishna Consciousness Society is about introducing spirituality to students. We aim to reach beyond the boundaries of caste, creed and colour, by establishing the science of the soul, and to help students find spiritual solutions to material problems such as alcoholism, drug abuse, social and academic pressures by promoting simple living and high thinking. We place a greater emphasis on spirituality rather than any particular religion. The society also aims to put students in touch with Eastern spiritual techniques, such as yoga and meditation, so they can apply ancient wisdom to modern life as a student, something that we feel is becoming more popular here in the UK. It also aims to create an non- judgemental, open and safe environment in which students can discuss and ask questions about faith and philosophy without having to belong to any religion or culture.

Previous productions include ‘Curtains’, ‘Pippin’, 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels', and most recently, 'Legally Blonde'. During third term, we produce our 24-hour Opera - a musical planned in secret and revealed to the cast the day before the performance, so the whole show is prepped in 24 hours! Recent productions include 'Mamma Mia', ‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show’, and ‘Kinky Boots’, with all proceeds going to charity. Light Opera is one of the most active societies within ICSM, organising at least two socials per week in first term. These nights out, along with the annual Opera Tour, will make your first term the best few months of your life! And with events like our annual Opera Dinner during second term, our ‘Big Chills’ (open-mic nights at Reynolds Bar), and ‘UH Revue’ (a sketch show competition with other London medical schools), the rest of your year will be filled with activities! The Light Opera family ranges from complete novices to those who were doing jazz hands in utero, with members spanning all years of ICSM, as well as many non-medic members!

Building a strong network within and beyond Imperial College is our mission. An example is the careers talk we held with Norway’s Sovereign Wealth fund last year. Have questions or simply want to chat? Find us at our stall during the Freshers' Fair. We can't wait to meet you and welcome you to our vibrant Nordic community.

At the heart of what we do is a strong sense of community that we aim to foster via frequent events throughout the year, ranging from academic to more social. We organise tutorials for Years 1, 2 and 5 as well as mock PACES for our fifth-year students. Reproductive & Developmental Sciences BSc students are offered tutorials, as well as mentors, to help guide them through their coursework and research projects. Innovative talks and seminars are also held each term to raise awareness of important topics in the field such as FGM, postnatal depression and miscarriage. We also provide opportunities for our members to network with O&G professionals in order to support students interested in pursuing specialty training in these niche areas. This year, we held our very first Journal Club which has seen an impressive numbers of students in attendance. Every month, a scientific article proposed by two members of our society is brought forth and discussed, helping to nurture an interest in research for those with a passion in this field. In 2018, we held our first independent undergraduate conference, which continues to be well-attended, drawing in students from universities all over the country. We hope to further expand our reach by making our conference bigger and more impactful every year. Additionally, we host a range of events such as our Welcome Social and collaborative fundraising events with London uni O&G societies to help bring together a community of students with an interest in this specialty. Join our mailing list and follow us on social media (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) for updated information on all our events and external opportunities! Please get in touch with us by DMing us on social media or via email at obscar@ic.ac.uk! Don't miss out and get your membership NOW!

We have a highly deserved reputation as being a very sociable orchestra, with socials organised throughout the year, and our weekend away in first term is a great ice-breaker for new players! Our fun-loving nature does not detract from our playing, however, and we put on fantastic performances three times a year, with some distinguished young soloists from Imperial. We are also one of the most travelled musical societies, touring yearly to locations such as Valencia, Croatia, Romania, as well as joint tours with ICSO to Prague and most recently Zaragoza and Burgos. We are always on the lookout for new players - no audition is required for strings or percussion, and we have occasional vacancies in woodwind, horns and brass.

We aim to provide you with the best preparation possible for exams. •Whether you are set on finding a cure for cancer through research, keen on pursuing a career in pharmaceuticals, or simply want to learn about the side effects of aspirin for your exams - we are the society for you! •Importantly, we emphasise that students from ANY Imperial College faculty are welcome to join as members - all that is required is a curiosity and interest in pharmacology! •Our 3 key aims are as follows: 1. Revision series and tutorials for junior medical students, led by older years, to help develop a solid understanding of the syllabus and integrate this into their future clinical careers. 2. Cutting-edge talks by renowned speakers from medical, pharmaceutical and research backgrounds, aimed at cultivating interest in pharm careers or research among medical, science and business students! 3. Demystify pharmacology as a dull and complex topic!

Trips to the National Shooting Centre, Bisley, occur 2-3 times a term, giving members the opportunity to shoot fullbore at distances from 100 to 1000 yards. We also regularly run clays trips to nearby grounds where members can enjoy English Sporting Clays. We have now run two successful tours to Jersey as guests of the Jersey Pistol Club and aim to continue this. Every year, we enter several teams and individuals into BUCS Clays, Fullbore, and Smallbore, where we have always excelled and even won in the past.

We have training sessions, run by our two coaches, on Monday nights at Old Deer Park in Richmond, home of ex-Premiership London Welsh RFC. We play matches on Wednesday afternoons, with our home ground being Imperial’s Harlington Sports Ground. Forwards are also invited to attend dedicated lineout sessions on Tuesday mornings before lectures near campus. Our three teams cater for all abilities and availabilities; our 1XV compete in the BUCS South Eastern 2nd Tier, with the 2XV and 3XV playing in the 3rd and 5th Tier respectively. Both our 1XV and 2XV were battling for promotion but missed out by a single result, however both teams had an unbeaten cup run, with the 1XV winning the South Eastern Conference Cup. Teams aren’t ringfenced, so every week there’s opportunity to move between teams. Every Wednesday evening, our two social secs cook up a variety of fun and interesting socials, with promised crossovers with a range of Netball clubs. Expect silly games, drinks and lots of laughs, without the culture that gives university rugby teams their usual reputation. The club has two major annual varsity matches: one against Imperial Medics and the other against LSE in The City Varsity. These exciting showcase events are the highlight of the season, both for spectators and players, and are a fantastic opportunity to be part of something special. The City Varsity, organized by our club, has become a highly anticipated event in recent years, and last year raised over £2200 for the Matt Hampson Foundation, while drawing in hundreds of spectators.

In 1874, they played in the first ever United Hospitals Cup - the oldest rugby cup competition in the world, and one of the first ever official competitions to be played with 15 players on each side.

      "description": "Rugby is easy to pick up and play without any previous experience. In fact, most of the squad had never played rugby before coming to Imperial! Matches are played on Wednesday afternoons, with training on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. And in 2022/23 we were Imperial's Team of the Year!! We excel both on and off the pitch as a famously sociable and friendly bunch. Our weekly socials include pubs, games, dinners and amazing fancy dress. We also love to tour and usually put on 2 very affordable tours every year (some as cheap as £20 for the whole weekend!). Past tours include Paris, Southampton, Cardiff, Seville and Vienna. We're a friendly, diverse crowd so whether you're looking to try a new, engaging sport with a great group of people or if you're a more experienced player, ICUWRFC is the place for you!

All members have access to club boats so you can sail whenever you want, should you want to escape the busy London life once a while. Furthermore, we host Summer Sail Week, our annual trip where we rent yachts and sail around either Greece or Croatia for a week. This year we will be visiting the Saronic Gulf, between the 7th and 14th of September. Tickets sell out extremely fast so keep your ears peeled for more information regarding the trip! If experience is anything to go by, it is not a trip to be missed. So, if you want to learn or improve, compete at universities over the country, be part of a team, escape central London and make lots of new friends then this is the club for you.

In addition to distributing food and hot beverages to those in need, we also have friendly, non-judgemental conversations with them when we talk about anything and everything. In some cases you may be the first person they've talked to for a whole day! Soup Run is much more than just giving out material things - we meet and interact with a variety of people in need that range from rough sleepers to people who have lost their job or are victims of broken home. We believe it is a valuable experience through which you will gain many life-skills while also having the opportunity to meet genuine people from Imperial with the same values who enjoy volunteering in a relaxed, friendly and fun environment, and knowing you have made a real difference in many people's lives. We are part of the London Soup Run Forum and give hot meals out on Sundays in Lincoln's Inn Fields (near Holborn). Joining our society is free and no commitment is required - feel free to attend when you have the time for a worthwhile break and want to join us for a good cause! CSP Chair / President",

Our musical director is Chris Braime, who helped found the society back in 2004 from talented string players who wanted the more intimate experience of a string ensemble. As Imperial College's only ensemble just for string players, we offer a very different experience to the symphony orchestras. Rehearsals are relaxed with light refreshments, but the music is always fun and challenging and every member has the chance to make a difference. We perform at the end of each term in the local area, as well as organising social days for the players to get to know each other. Rehearsals are held on Friday evenings, with the group going for dinner afterwards. Our rehearsals start from 6pm (baton down at 6.15) on every Friday, usually in the Great Hall, but venues may change week to week. If you're interested in making yourself heard as a string player, why don't you join us? Drop us an email at icse@ic.ac.uk if you have any queries!

Our members range from beginners to athletes competing internationally, so provided you’re confident swimming unaided, we've got something for you! With more training, friendly members and social events than you could ever need, ICSWP is a club you will find your home in. If you're looking to improve your technique, we can help you learn a new stroke or perfect your shot. You can dive into both swimming and water polo, with plenty of opportunities to test your skills in friendly competitions against local universities. For those seeking more of a challenge, we compete in the BUCS National Championships (both long and short course) against the best swimmers in the country. Our Men's and Women's Water Polo teams represent Imperial in the BUCS leagues across the UK. We compete in local leagues too, with two mixed teams in the London Water Polo league - great for improving your skills and having some friendly competition at a lower, more relaxed level. Finally, we also have an international Winter Tour and Summer Tour each year - a great time to get to know everyone in the club outside the pool!

All levels of synchro swimmers are welcome and your first session is free! We are the Imperial Synchronised Swimming Team open to both experienced artistic swimmers and complete beginners of all genders (as long as you are a confident swimmer). Whether you want to learn a new skill or keep fit at university IC Synchro is the place for you. The club offers anyone of all abilities, the chance to improve (or learn) great technique in the water while having fun (and toning those abs and legs!). We will also improve our flexibility and strength with land training sessions, so if you want to learn to do the splits this year come along! And with training twice a week at Imperial’s South Kensington campus, once in the water and once on land, it is easy to fit synchro in around your busy academic schedule. At the end of the year, everyone will have the chance attend an interuniversity showcase for the public where we will perform routines that fit all levels, including ex-competitive swimmers and those who have only just started. With an amazingly friendly team (who you will get to know at our socials throughout the year) and the possibility to master a new sport you must be tempted... If you want to try something new, join us! Keep your eyes peeled on our social media to see what we’re up to or contact us for more info!

Built in 1902, this James & Browne was purchased by Guilds students in 1933 and has remained with the college ever since. Derrick, the 1926 Ner-A-Car is the second motorised mascot of the CGCU. They are some of the most exercised veteran vehicles still on the road, maintained by the dedicated students of Imperial. We take part in the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run each November, and we are keen to take out these vehicles for a drive as often as possible throughout the year. Thanks to the early 20th century engineering, we also have plenty of opportunities to get our hands dirty performing maintenance and servicing. Our regular Wednesday afternoon garage sessions are often followed by a well-earned visit to the pub. Don’t worry, these pieces of early British automotive engineering are very simple, you can easily understand how they work, even without previous mechanical experience. If you are keen on cars or motorcycles, looking for a practical, hands-on pastime, or the romance of the early 1900s makes your heart beat faster, we offer beautiful historic vehicles, good company, and fun events throughout the year – get in touch via email or social media.

Every Wednesday we visit a different primary school and teach children about simple topics in Medicine. For example, how to call 999; what exactly a ‘surgery’ is; why washing your hands is important or what is the purpose of a skeleton! At the same time, we provide our volunteers with an opportunity to help the community, practice skills in paediatrics by interacting with children and even improve their teaching skills. We are a very low-commitment group – so you can join us as often or as rarely as you want! So, if you are passionate about teaching children about medicine, looking to do some low-commitment volunteering or simply curious about what we do, join us!

We have performed in venues ranging from village halls to the famous beer hall Hofbräuhaus to a rugby stadium in front of over a thousand spectators. This year we’re also running both Flute Choir and Clarinet Choir: 2 sub-groups rehearsing from 16:45 to 18:00 every Tuesday in the Blyth Centre. Conducted by Wind Band’s music director Alan Shellard, both groups have a few performances each year in Wind Band concerts and busking sessions. These groups are open to all flautists and clarinettists, not just those who play in Wind Band – if you like playing with other flutes or clarinets, or want to try other types of flutes or clarinets, then flute and clarinet choir are for you!
